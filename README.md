# Saber Portfolio Starter

A simple portfolio starter theme for Saber. Based on the [Gridsome Portfolio Starter](https://github.com/drehimself/gridsome-portfolio-starter)

## Features

- Clean and minimal design
- [Tailwind CSS v1](https://tailwindcss.com) (with PurgeCSS)
- Scroll to sections using [vue-scrollto](https://github.com/rigor789/vue-scrollto)
- Blog with markdown content for posts
- Theme Switcher with Dark Mode
- Syntax highlighting with [Prism.js](https://saber.land/docs/markdown-features.html#code-highlighting)

## Installation

I understand that I'm not following the [recommended way to create themes in Saber](https://saber.land/docs/themes.html). I personally think that cloning it from a repo with saber already installed is a much faster workflow.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/drehimself/saber-portfolio-starter.git`
2. `cd saber-portfolio-starter`
3. `yarn`
4. `yarn saber` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:3000`.
5. `yarn saber build` to build for production locally into a `public` folder. You can use `yarn saber serve` to serve it.

## Notes

 - Based on the [Gridsome Portfolio Starter](https://github.com/drehimself/gridsome-portfolio-starter).
 - WIP: More features coming soon.
